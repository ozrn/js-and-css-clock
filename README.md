# JS30 #2: css-js clock
This is the second project of JS30 challenges by Wes Boss and shows how to build a simple analog clock that displays the current time using CSS and JS.<br><br>
What this does is it takes in the current time from JS and then updates second,minute and hour hands based on the current time that we see.
